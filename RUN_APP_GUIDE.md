2. **User Inputs**: When you log mood, flow, pain, or nutrition
3. **AI Processing**: Data sent to backend AI agents for analysis
4. **Live Updates**: Results appear in the AI Insights tab

### **What the AI Agents Do**
- **SAA (Signal Analysis Agent)**: Analyzes your health data
- **DPGA (Dynamic Prompt Generator)**: Creates personalized recommendations
- **Morph Integration**: Suggests UI adaptations

### **Example AI Insights You'll See**
- Risk scores based on your data
- Cycle phase detection (menstrual, follicular, etc.)
- Health alerts for abnormalities
- Personalized recommendations
- UI component suggestions

## 🧪 **Testing the Integration**

### **Test 1: Basic Navigation**
1. Launch the app
2. Navigate through all 5 tabs
3. Verify the beautiful water-themed UI loads correctly

### **Test 2: AI Insights Tab**
1. Go to the "AI Insights" tab
2. You should see:
   - AI analysis results
   - Risk assessment
   - Health recommendations
   - UI adaptation suggestions

### **Test 3: Data Logging**
1. Go to "Home Dashboard"
2. Try logging some data:
   - Tap mood buttons (calm, happy, low, etc.)
   - Tap flow buttons (spotting, light, medium, heavy)
   - Tap pain buttons (none, crampy, backache, etc.)
3. Check the "AI Insights" tab to see how the AI responds

### **Test 4: Calendar Interaction**
1. In "Home Dashboard", interact with the calendar
2. Tap dates to toggle period start/end
3. Watch how this affects AI predictions

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If the app doesn't build:**
1. Check that you have Xcode 15+ installed
2. Make sure you're on macOS
3. Try cleaning the build: `Cmd + Shift + K`
4. Try building again: `Cmd + R`

### **If the app crashes:**
1. Check the Xcode console for error messages
2. Verify the backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
3. Restart the backend: `cd backend && npm start`

### **If AI Insights are empty:**
1. Make sure the backend is running
2. Try logging some data in the Home tab
3. Check the backend logs for any errors

### **If you see network errors:**
1. The app is configured for `localhost:3000`
2. For physical devices, you may need to update the URL in `NetworkService.swift`
3. Change `localhost` to your computer's IP address
